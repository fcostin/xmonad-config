my xmonad config

Dependencies:

	xmonad, of course
	xmobar, for the status bar up the top
	feh, to set the background

Confusion:

	choosing the 'xmonad' session when logging in doesn't seem to execute .xsession
	instead, choose the user defined session
		- there is probably some way to define a better name for this
