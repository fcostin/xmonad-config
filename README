my xmonad config, largely based upon

	http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen's_Configuration

Dependencies:

	xmonad, of course
	xmobar, for the status bar up the top
	feh, to set the background
	scrot, for taking screenies

Confusion:

	choosing the 'xmonad' session when logging in doesn't seem to execute .xsession
	instead, choose the user defined session
		- there is probably some way to define a better name for this
